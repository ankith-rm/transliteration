# Transliteration

## Transliteration vs Translation. What's the difference?

My project over here deals with transliteration. Some of you might wonder, "Why did you make this? Google translate already exists". Well, slow down buddy. That is what is called translating. Translating simply means showing the meaning of a word or a sentence in one language to another language.  

Here are some examples example of translation to other languages
* **ख़रगोश** (Hindi, Devanagari Script) &rarr; **Rabbit** (English, Latin Script)
* **ನಾಳೆ** (Kannada, Kannada Script) &rarr; **غداً** (Arabic, Perso-Arabic Script)
*  **House** (English, Latin Script) &rarr; **Maison** (French, Latin Script)
* **διακοπές** (Greek, Greek Script) &rarr; **ਛੁੱਟੀ** (Punjabi, Shahmukhi Script)

Transliteration, on the other hand, simply means changing the sound of a piece of text from one writing script to another writing script.

Here are some transliteration examples of Hindi words transliterated from the Devanagari script to Latin script and IPA:  
* **ख़रगोश** &rarr; khargosh &rarr; /xɐɾɐ.ɡoːʃ/
* **सूरज** &rarr; sooraj &rarr; /suː.ɾəd͡ʒ/
* **विद्यालय** &rarr; vidyaalaya &rarr; /ʋɪd̪.jɑː.lə.jə/
* **खिड़की** &rarr; khidkee &rarr; /kʰɪɽ.kiː/

## Brahmi Script, Abugidas and Indian writing systems

The Brahmi script is an ancient writing systems used in the Indian subcontinent and is considered the ancestor of most of the modern Indian scripts. It eventually gave rise to scripts commonly used in the subcontinent today such as Devanagari, Tamil, Sinhala, Bengali-Assamese, and Tibetan. It also gave rise to scripts outside the subcontinent such as Thai, Lao, Javanese and Balinese.

### Abugidas

An abugida is a writing system, just like an alphabet or abjad writing system. In an alphabet system, each different letter is used to denote a different sound, whether be a vowel or consonant. Scripts that are alphebtic include Latin, Cyrillic and Greek.  
Abugidas, on the other hand, do it a little different. In this writing system, all the consonants are written out as letters, and vowel sounds are represented by small vowel marks or diacritics. Outside of South and SE Asia, abugiads are also the writing system of the Ge'ez Script of Ethiopia and Inuktitut of Canada.
